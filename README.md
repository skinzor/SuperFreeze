SuperFreeze
===========

We are moving to GitLab!
------------------------

All development is made at https://gitlab.com/SuperFreezeApp/SuperFreeze/. However, the GitHub repository will serve as a mirror and you can also open issues here, if you want to.

Recently, Microsoft announced to buy GitHub. We value Microsoft's efforts to become more involved with the Open Source world but there are just too many disadvantages GitHub has now:

* It is one, central instance
* It is owned by a company that already is even more powerful
* GitHub is not Open Source itself
* To host an own instance of GitHub you have to pay
* Microsoft has some other bad habits like paying too few taxes in some countries.

By the way, in our opinion Google is too powerful as well and we encourage everyone to use a custom ROM like [LineageOS](https://lineageos.org/) instead of the "normal" Android.

Description
-----------

An android app that makes it possible to entirely freeze all background activities of an app.
Currently, the user has to force stop apps by hand, SuperFreeze only shows the app settings page.

Greenify is another app that can do this, but it is not Open Source.

Any contributions are welcome.

SuperFreeze is not yet another task manager promising to delete 10GB of data per month or making your device 2x as fast. This is impossible. You should freeze only
* apps that you do not trust (and do not want to run in background) and 
* apps that you use very few.

If you freeze apps that you use daily, the battery of your device will drain faster and these apps will take longer to load.

Features
--------

* Works without accessibility service as this slows down the device

If you have a problem or a question or an idea or whatever, just open an issue!

If you would like to help, have a look at the issues or think about what could be improved and open an issue for it. Please tell me what you are going to do to avoid that I also implement the same thing at the same time :-)
